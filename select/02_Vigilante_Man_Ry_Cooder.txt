(Woody Guthrie)
(E) - (A) - (B7) Capo on 1

(E) Have you seen that (A) vigilante (E) man?
(A) Have you (E) seen that (A) vigilante (E) man?
(A) Have you (E) seen that (A) vigilante (E) man?
I've been hearin' his (B7) name all over the (E) land.

Rainy nights down in the engine house,
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse,
A man came along and he chased us out in the rain.
Was that a vigilante man?

Well, I rambled around from town to town,
Now, I rambled around from town to town,
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle.
Was that the vigilante man?

Well, why does a vigilante man?
Tell me why does a vigilante man?
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've been hearin' his name all over the land.
