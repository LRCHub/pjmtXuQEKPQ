Racing in the shadows pounding of the feet
While the old men get to praying
And the children try to sleep
Just another promise they don't really care
'Cause the movement on the borders
Got the people running scared

Standing on the corner never got things done
If you leave your front door open
You'll be the foolish one
No misunderstanding no honour among thieves
It's a sorry situation
When a gun is all you need

Go call the vigilante
He'll turn this place upside down
Go call the vigilante
He don't get kicked around

Hold on there's a new way a comin'
Looks like it's arriving tonight
There's no more hiding or running
There's no more walking on ice
