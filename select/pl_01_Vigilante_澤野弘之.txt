I'll keep looking
I'll turn every stone for you
Every night
I cry in agony for you
It's like you call again
and again
Inside my soul,
I hear you calling
Heavy clouds hanging on us
But no one is bringing you down
So loud the voice
(Loud the in my head)
Vigilante might not dead
(she might not be dead)
Couldn't confess all heart
(Confess all my heart)
The rainbow it was
just the start
(It was the start)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
I keep hiding this feeling
I have for you
I got regrets 'bout
what I was meant to do
It's like you call again
and again
Inside my head I'm going crazy
Heavy clouds hanging on us
But no one is bringing you down
So loud the voice in head
(Loud the in my head)
Vigilante might not dead
(she might not be dead)
Couldn't confess all heart
(Confess all my heart)
The rainbow it was
just the start
(It was the start)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
So loud the voice in head
(Loud the in my head)
Vigilante might not dead
(she might not be dead)
Couldn't confess all heart
(Confess all my heart)
The rainbow it was
just the start
(It was the start)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
Wo oh o oh! Don't you know?
(Is there heaven?)
